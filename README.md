## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Who is me?

My name is Thomas Sankara. I am a Front-end Web Developer. I love ReactJs and NextJs. I have also come to love doing YouTube tutorials [here](https://youtube.com/tsbsankara) which led me to do a Udemy course.
I call myself tsbsankara on all social media except GitHub because my GitHub profile was one which at the time of creation, I didn't think I would use all that much. I was wrong.
Also, the title is correct as you read it.

### What I'm currently learning

1. Recently I coaxed myself into learning design because even though I have a good eye for design, I wasn't a good designer myself. I've picked up Figma in the recent past and it is working out very well. I have created a repository with my Figma designs - as terrible as they are - which you can find [here](https://github.com/SankThomas/figma-designs).
2. I am also learning GatsbyJs and React Native, and I am looking to pick up VueJs in the future. That's my 12-month plan. (Don't hold me to it)

### Hobbies

1. I love "Design to Code" challenges because they are not only engaging, they also teach you design principles and can the jumpstart you need into to Front-end developer career.
2. I write poems to express how I feel about something - you might read some of them in future but they are all in a vault for now.
3. I think a lot. I don't know whether this qualifies as a hobby. I write what I think which usually isn't really "normal stuff" but I like it. I decided to compile all that stuff into one big book filled with my thoughts. Do you want to read it? I do too.

### What I do now

- Just to mention something I like saying - The world is backwards. You need experience to get a job, but you need a job to get experience, and no one is willing to hire someone without experience - at least that's the situation where I'm from.
- I do occasional livestreams on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/tsbsankara) and [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/tsbsankara) just because I think it is fun and it poses a challenge because doing something live, and doing a recorded version of it are not the same thing.
