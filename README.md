## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Who am I?

My name is Thomas Sankara. I am a front-end web designer and developer. I use Figma and ReactJs mainly, and I am based in Nairobi, Kenya.

### What I'm currently learning

1. I am improving my web design knowledge by continually building web apps, websites and mobile apps in Figma.
2. GROQ query language from [Sanity](https://sanity.io).

### Goals
1. I run [my YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/@tsbsankara) where I post videos about projects I build, designs I make and challenges I complete. What started off as a way to show recruiters that I can actually do the things they interview about has now become something that I want to make long term. So my current goal is to get up to 100,000 Subscribers (currently at 3,200) and to reach 100,000 daily views (currently at 20,000).
2. I'm building a catalogue of projects, both designs and builds - all completely free and accessible. 
  - I currently only have 3 projects on [this Figma board](https://www.figma.com/file/NnQdyln5hME3qCY3OXxtby/Designs?node-id=0%3A1). I will be using this board for all web design projects. I will let you know of any changes.
  - I (might) also create a dedicated repository for the projects. However I'm thinking about linking the respective repositories in the designs so that no one repo will be extremely huge and daunting.

### Hobbies

1. I love "Design to Code" challenges because they are not only engaging, they also teach you design principles and can the jumpstart you need into to Front-end developer career.
2. I write poems to express how I feel about something - you might read some of them in future but they are all in a vault for now.
3. I think a lot. I don't know whether this qualifies as a hobby. I also write what I think which usually isn't really "normal stuff" (not normal to me at least) but I like it. I decided to compile all that stuff into one big book filled with my thoughts. Do you want to read it? I do too.
